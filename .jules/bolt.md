## 2024-05-24 - Missing Database Index Causes Full Table Scans
**Learning:** SQLite's `JSON_GROUP_ARRAY` correlated subqueries rely heavily on indexes. Without an index on `history_images(history_id, type)`, fetching paginated history triggers full table scans on `history_images` for every row retrieved. This O(N) penalty becomes a severe backend bottleneck as the number of generated images grows.
**Action:** Always verify that foreign keys and fields heavily queried inside `SELECT` subqueries or joins have proper compound indexes defined in both the migration scripts (`scripts/migrate.ts`) and replicated exactly in testing schema files.

## 2024-05-24 - Missing Database Index Causes Full Table Scans for History Pagination
**Learning:** SQLite's `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` combined with filtering by `username` triggers a full table scan and a temporary B-Tree for sorting without a composite index on `(username, timestamp DESC)`. This O(N log N) penalty becomes a severe backend bottleneck as user history grows.
**Action:** Always ensure that frequently paginated or ordered queries have a corresponding composite index defined in both the migration scripts (`scripts/migrate.ts`) and replicated exactly in testing schema files.

## 2026-03-11 - Missing Database Index Causes Full Table Scans for Global History Pagination
**Learning:** SQLite's `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` triggers a full table scan and a temporary B-Tree for sorting without an index on `(timestamp DESC)`. This O(N log N) penalty becomes a severe backend bottleneck when paginating through all users' history globally.
**Action:** Always ensure that frequently paginated or ordered queries have a corresponding index defined in both the migration scripts (`scripts/migrate.ts`) and replicated exactly in testing schema files.

## 2026-04-22 - JSON Evaluation Penalty During Pagination
**Learning:** Queries that filter based on the presence or absence of JSON data using `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` (like the image/video filters in `history.repository.ts`) force SQLite to evaluate the full row for every entry if an index isn't present, abandoning fast O(1) lookups.
**Action:** When filtering paginated lists that evaluate NULL states for specific sub-categories, create partial indexes using `WHERE condition` to skip full row evaluation and JSON deserialization entirely.
