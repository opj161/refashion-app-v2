## 2024-05-24 - Missing Database Index Causes Full Table Scans
**Learning:** SQLite's `JSON_GROUP_ARRAY` correlated subqueries rely heavily on indexes. Without an index on `history_images(history_id, type)`, fetching paginated history triggers full table scans on `history_images` for every row retrieved. This O(N) penalty becomes a severe backend bottleneck as the number of generated images grows.
**Action:** Always verify that foreign keys and fields heavily queried inside `SELECT` subqueries or joins have proper compound indexes defined in both the migration scripts (`scripts/migrate.ts`) and replicated exactly in testing schema files.

## 2024-05-24 - Missing Database Index Causes Full Table Scans for History Pagination
**Learning:** SQLite's `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` combined with filtering by `username` triggers a full table scan and a temporary B-Tree for sorting without a composite index on `(username, timestamp DESC)`. This O(N log N) penalty becomes a severe backend bottleneck as user history grows.
**Action:** Always ensure that frequently paginated or ordered queries have a corresponding composite index defined in both the migration scripts (`scripts/migrate.ts`) and replicated exactly in testing schema files.

## 2026-03-11 - Missing Database Index Causes Full Table Scans for Global History Pagination
**Learning:** SQLite's `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` triggers a full table scan and a temporary B-Tree for sorting without an index on `(timestamp DESC)`. This O(N log N) penalty becomes a severe backend bottleneck when paginating through all users' history globally.
**Action:** Always ensure that frequently paginated or ordered queries have a corresponding index defined in both the migration scripts (`scripts/migrate.ts`) and replicated exactly in testing schema files.

## 2024-05-24 - Missing Partial Indexes for Null Checks Causes Full Table Scans in Pagination
**Learning:** SQLite's `COUNT(*)` and paginated `SELECT` queries that use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` conditions alongside `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` will trigger full table scans or use less efficient indexes, resulting in O(N log N) sorts. The `getPaginatedHistoryForUser` function suffered from this when filtering for image/video types via `videoGenerationParams IS NULL`.
**Action:** Always create partial indexes (`CREATE INDEX ... WHERE column IS NULL`) to perfectly cover filtered pagination and counting queries, ensuring they are mirrored precisely in migration tests (`database.migration.test.ts`).
