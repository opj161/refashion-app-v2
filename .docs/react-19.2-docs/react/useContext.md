## Reference

### `useContext(SomeContext)`

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

```jsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
function MyComponent() {
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
// ...
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters

- `SomeContext`: The context that you’ve previously created with [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext). The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.

#### Returns

`useContext` returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the `value` passed to the closest `SomeContext` above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the `defaultValue` you have passed to [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext) for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

#### Caveats

- `useContext()` call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the _same_ component. The corresponding `<Context>` **needs to be _above_** the component doing the `useContext()` call.
- React **automatically re-renders** all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different `value`. The previous and the next values are compared with the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. Skipping re-renders with [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.
- If your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context. Passing something via context only works if `SomeContext` that you use to provide context and `SomeContext` that you use to read it are **_exactly_ the same object**, as determined by a `===` comparison.

## Usage

### Passing data deeply into the tree

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

```jsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
function Button() {
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
// ...
```

`useContext` returns the context value for the context you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds **the closest context provider above** for that particular context.

To pass context to a `Button`, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider:

```jsx
function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext value="dark">
      <Form />
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}
function Form() {
  // ... renders buttons inside ...
}
```

It doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the `Button`. When a `Button` _anywhere_ inside of `Form` calls `useContext(ThemeContext)`, it will receive `"dark"` as the value.

### Pitfall

`useContext()` always looks for the closest provider _above_ the component that calls it. It searches upwards and **does not** consider providers in the component from which you’re calling `useContext()`.

App.js

App.js

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext } from "react";
const ThemeContext = createContext(null);
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext value="dark">
      <Form />
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}
function Form() {
  return (
    <Panel title="Welcome">
      <Button>Sign up</Button>
      <Button>Log in</Button>
    </Panel>
  );
}
function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  const className = "panel-" + theme;
  return (
    <section className={className}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}
function Button({ children }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  const className = "button-" + theme;
  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>;
}
```

### Updating data passed via context

Often, you’ll want the context to change over time. To update context, combine it with [state.](/reference/react/useState) Declare a state variable in the parent component, and pass the current state down as the context value to the provider.

```jsx
function MyPage() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("dark");
  return (
    <ThemeContext value={theme}>
      <Form />
      <Button
        onClick={() => {
          setTheme("light");
        }}
      >
        Switch to light theme
      </Button>
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}
```

Now any `Button` inside of the provider will receive the current `theme` value. If you call `setTheme` to update the `theme` value that you pass to the provider, all `Button` components will re-render with the new `'light'` value.

#### Examples of updating context

1. Updating a value via context 2. Updating an object via context 3. Multiple contexts 4. Extracting providers to a component 5. Scaling up with context and a reducer

#### Example 1 of 5: Updating a value via context

In this example, the `MyApp` component holds a state variable which is then passed to the `ThemeContext` provider. Checking the “Dark mode” checkbox updates the state. Changing the provided value re-renders all the components using that context.

export default function MyApp() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  return (
    <ThemeContext value={theme}>
      <Form />
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={theme === "dark"}
          onChange={(e) => {
            setTheme(e.target.checked ? "dark" : "light");
          }}
        />
        Use dark mode
      </label>
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}
function Form({ children }) {
  return (
    <Panel title="Welcome">
      <Button>Sign up</Button>
      <Button>Log in</Button>
    </Panel>
  );
}
function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  const className = "panel-" + theme;
  return (
    <section className={className}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}
function Button({ children }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  const className = "button-" + theme;
  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>;
}
```

Note that `value="dark"` passes the `"dark"` string, but `value={theme}` passes the value of the JavaScript `theme` variable with [JSX curly braces.](/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces) Curly braces also let you pass context values that aren’t strings.

### Specifying a fallback default value

If React can’t find any providers of that particular context in the parent tree, the context value returned by `useContext()` will be equal to the default value that you specified when you [created that context](/reference/react/createContext):

```jsx
const ThemeContext = createContext(null);
```

The default value **never changes**. If you want to update context, use it with state as [described above.](#updating-data-passed-via-context)

Often, instead of `null`, there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = createContext("light");
```

This way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won’t break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests.

In the example below, the “Toggle theme” button is always light because it’s **outside any theme context provider** and the default context theme value is `'light'`. Try editing the default theme to be `'dark'`.

App.js

App.js

ReloadClear[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";
const ThemeContext = createContext("light");
export default function MyApp() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  return (
    <>
      <ThemeContext value={theme}>
        <Form />
      </ThemeContext>
      <Button
        onClick={() => {
          setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark");
        }}
      >
        Toggle theme
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
function Form({ children }) {
  return (
    <Panel title="Welcome">
      <Button>Sign up</Button>
      <Button>Log in</Button>
    </Panel>
  );
}
function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  const className = "panel-" + theme;
  return (
    <section className={className}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}
function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  const className = "button-" + theme;
  return (
    <button className={className} onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

### Overriding context for a part of the tree

You can override the context for a part of the tree by wrapping that part in a provider with a different value.

```jsx
<ThemeContext value="dark">
  ...
  <ThemeContext value="light">
    <Footer />
  </ThemeContext>
  ...
</ThemeContext>
```

You can nest and override providers as many times as you need.

#### Examples of overriding context

1. Overriding a theme 2. Automatically nested headings

#### Example 1 of 2: Overriding a theme

Here, the button _inside_ the `Footer` receives a different context value (`"light"`) than the buttons outside (`"dark"`).

App.js

App.js

ReloadClear[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext } from "react";
const ThemeContext = createContext(null);
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext value="dark">
      <Form />
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}
function Form() {
  return (
    <Panel title="Welcome">
      <Button>Sign up</Button>
      <Button>Log in</Button>
      <ThemeContext value="light">
        <Footer />
      </ThemeContext>
    </Panel>
  );
}
function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      <Button>Settings</Button>
    </footer>
  );
}
function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  const className = "panel-" + theme;
  return (
    <section className={className}>
      {title && <h1>{title}</h1>}
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}
function Button({ children }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  const className = "button-" + theme;
  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>;
}

### Optimizing re-renders when passing objects and functions

You can pass any values via context, including objects and functions.

```jsx
function MyApp() {
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);
  function login(response) {
    storeCredentials(response.credentials);
    setCurrentUser(response.user);
  }
  return (
    <AuthContext value={{ currentUser, login }}>
      <Page />
    </AuthContext>
  );
}
```

Here, the context value is a JavaScript object with two properties, one of which is a function. Whenever `MyApp` re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a _different_ object pointing at a _different_ function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call `useContext(AuthContext)`.

In smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like `currentUser`, has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the `login` function with [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback) and wrap the object creation into [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo). This is a performance optimization:

```jsx
import { useCallback, useMemo } from "react";
function MyApp() {
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);
  const login = useCallback((response) => {
    storeCredentials(response.credentials);
    setCurrentUser(response.user);
  }, []);
  const contextValue = useMemo(
    () => ({
      currentUser,
      login,
    }),
    [currentUser, login],
  );
  return (
    <AuthContext value={contextValue}>
      <Page />
    </AuthContext>
  );
}
```

As a result of this change, even if `MyApp` needs to re-render, the components calling `useContext(AuthContext)` won’t need to re-render unless `currentUser` has changed.

## Troubleshooting

### My component doesn’t see the value from my provider

There are a few common ways that this can happen:

1. You’re rendering `<SomeContext>` in the same component (or below) as where you’re calling `useContext()`. Move `<SomeContext>` _above and outside_ the component calling `useContext()`.
2. You may have forgotten to wrap your component with `<SomeContext>`, or you might have put it in a different part of the tree than you thought. Check whether the hierarchy is right using [React DevTools.](/learn/react-developer-tools)
3. You might be running into some build issue with your tooling that causes `SomeContext` as seen from the providing component and `SomeContext` as seen by the reading component to be two different objects. This can happen if you use symlinks, for example. You can verify this by assigning them to globals like `window.SomeContext1` and `window.SomeContext2` and then checking whether `window.SomeContext1 === window.SomeContext2` in the console. If they’re not the same, fix that issue on the build tool level.

### I am always getting `undefined` from my context although the default value is different

You might have a provider without a `value` in the tree:

```jsx
// 🚩 Doesn't work: no value prop
<ThemeContext>
  <Button />
</ThemeContext>
```

If you forget to specify `value`, it’s like passing `value={undefined}`.

You may have also mistakingly used a different prop name by mistake:

```jsx
// 🚩 Doesn't work: prop should be called "value"
<ThemeContext theme={theme}>
  <Button />
</ThemeContext>
```

In both of these cases you should see a warning from React in the console. To fix them, call the prop `value`:

```jsx
// ✅ Passing the value prop
<ThemeContext value={theme}>
  <Button />
</ThemeContext>
```

Note that the [default value from your `createContext(defaultValue)` call](#specifying-a-fallback-default-value) is only used **if there is no matching provider above at all.** If there is a `<SomeContext value={undefined}>` component somewhere in the parent tree, the component calling `useContext(SomeContext)` _will_ receive `undefined` as the context value.
